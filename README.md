# cs1080-FinalProject
This final project is called Climb On. It is a website for climbers to use to assist in strength training and progression. The opening page has the user put in their name and it takes them to the homepage where it welcomes them by name. On the homepage there is an about section as well as a reviews section where the user can put in their own review. This is saved to local storage. There is a progress tracking page that allows users to enter what type of climb they did and what grade it was. It adds this to a table with the date as well. This is also in localStorage so users can go back to see what they previously entered. Finally there is a hangboard training page. This page allows users to choose from three workouts and then use the timer to know when to hangboard and when to rest.
